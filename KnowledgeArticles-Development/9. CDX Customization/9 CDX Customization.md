## D365 Commerce CDX Customization.

1. <ins>Background:</ins><br/>
During the D365 Commerce Project Implementation, create custom table and push and pull data between HQ and CSU database is very important, this article will show cases how to make CDX customization based on the official samples.
2. First of all, every time when a new extension sql script is deployed to CSU, it will recorded into the below table:<br/>
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM [crt].[RETAILUPGRADEHISTORY]
   ```
   <img width="1164" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db5d4248-0a55-4a53-8136-701fc58ec386"><br/>
   The same sql script will not be deployed two times, so in order to make some change on the original script,  you have to make a new script and named it in the aphebetic order, like ExtensionTableScriptV1.sql, ExtensionTableScriptV2.sql, ExtensionTableScriptV3.sql... ect.<br/>

3. The most knowledge of the CDX customization comes from these two official document: <br/>
    ### https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/dev-itpro/cdx-extensibility
    ### https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/dev-itpro/channel-db-extensions#adding-a-new-table
4.  The below knowledge all comes from the above two documents<br/>
+ Step 1:  let us review the XML for Custom Job and Subjobs creation including the table field mapping between HQ table and Channel Table:<br/>
```xml

  <Jobs>
    <!--Adding a new download job to push the records in ContosoRetailSeatingData. It is not a must to create a new Job. Note that the subjob can be configured to run under existing jobs-->

    </Subjob>

    <!--Adding additional columns to (existing) RetailTransactionTable so they are pulled back to AX.
For upload subjobs, set the OverrideTarget property to  "false", as ilustrate below. This will tell CDX to use the table defined by TargetTableName and TargetTableSchema as extension table on this subjob.
        This table must be created on the channel DB with the same primary key as the extended table (in this example, RetailTransactionTable).
    -->
    <Subjob Id="RetailTransactionTable" TargetTableName="CONTOSORETAILTRANSACTIONTABLE" TargetTableSchema="ext" OverrideTarget="false">

        <!--If you notice the existing columns are not listed here in the <Field> tag, this is because the eisting fields are already mapped mapped in the main RetailCdxSeedData resource file we only add the delta here. -->
        <Field Name="ContosoRetailSeatNumber" />

      </ScheduledByJobs>
      <AxFields>
        <Field Name="SuggestionId" />
        <Field Name="StoreId" />        
        <Field Name="TerminalId" />

    </Subjob>

    <!--Adding new subjob to existing download job-->
    <!--Note the TargetTableName attribute is used if the AX side table and its corresponding channelTable names are different. 
    If the AX and channel side table are the same there is no need to specify the TargetTableName only specifying the AXTableName is enough.-->
    <Subjob Id="ContosoRetailSeatingData" AxTableName ="ContosoRetailSeatingData" TargetTableName="ContosoRetailTableData" TargetTableSchema="ext">

      <AxFields>
        <Field Name="SeatNumber" />
        <!--Not a best practice but if you want the column names to be different on the ax and channel side u can do it using the toName attribute of <Field>-->

    the AXTableName is already specified in the original CDXSeedData resource file. 
    Notice that the name of the table on the target/channel side is set using the  TargetTableName="ContosoRetailChannelTable" change the targetTableName 
    is a recommended practice if you are modifying an existing table.  This will help to avoid naming conflict if the same table is customized by different partners.-->

    <!--Updating subjob to include previously not pushed columns or new extension columns-->
    <!--table with non RECID primary key-->
    <!--Notice that the target table name is changed to avoid naming conflict in case the same table is customized by several partners. This is a best practice eventhough using the same name will also work.-->
    <Subjob Id="RetailCustTable" TargetTableName="ContosoRetailCustTable" TargetTableSchema="ext"> <!--The AXTableName attribute is not used here because this is an already existing subjob and we are only changing the mapping. So no need to specify values of the attributes that we dont need to change -->

  5. How to verify the custome CDX is working or not? <br/>
      + For RetailTrasactionTable and RetailTransactionPaymentTrans, create a new record and provide value to the custom field:
     ```sql
      select  T.TRANSACTIONID, * from ax.retailTransactionTable as T where T.RECEIPTID =  'STONN-42100236'
      
      insert into ext.CONTOSORETAILTRANSACTIONTABLE
      (TRANSACTIONID, STORE, CHANNEL, TERMINAL, DATAAREAID, CONTOSORETAILSEATNUMBER, CONTOSORETAILSERVERSTAFFID) 
      select TRANSACTIONID TRANSACTIONID, STORE, CHANNEL, TERMINAL, DATAAREAID, 10, '000160' from ax.retailTransactionTable as T
      where T.RECEIPTID =  'STONN-42100236'
      
      INSERT INTO [ext].[CONTOSORETAILTRANSACTIONPAYMENTTRANS]
                 ([CHANNEL]
                 ,[STORE]
                 ,[TERMINAL]
                 ,[DATAAREAID]
                 ,[TRANSACTIONID]
                 ,[LINENUM]
                 ,[BANKTRANSFERCOMMENT])
      SELECT [CHANNEL]
      		,[STORE]
      		,[TERMINAL]
      		,[DATAAREAID]
      		,[TRANSACTIONID]

      from ax.RETAILTRANSACTIONPAYMENTTRANS where TransactionId = 'HOUSTON-HOUSTON-42-1728640504337'
      
      select * from ext.CONTOSORETAILTRANSACTIONTABLE where TransactionId = 'HOUSTON-HOUSTON-42-1728640504337'
      select * from ext.ContosoRetailTransactionPaymentTrans where TransactionId = 'HOUSTON-HOUSTON-42-1728640504337'
